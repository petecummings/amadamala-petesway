Late night things I did today includes

- Registered madamala.org domain from Name.com (Clean and straight forward compared to godaddy.com)
- Configured anil@madamala.org email address.
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for blogging.
- Watched Game of Thrones, Red Wedding. Most traumatizing experience. Master piece.
