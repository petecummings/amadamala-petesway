You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight java %}
Public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args)  {
		System.out.println("Hello World")
	}
}
#=> prints 'Hello World' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
